BEFORE YOU START:
- you need Unity 2020.2+ 
- you need HD RP pipline 10.2+
- there is wind prefab which will manage wind at your scene
Be patient this tech is so fluid... we coudn't fallow ever beta version
Make note that hd rp doesnt have grass system at terrain yet at all so demo with terrain is not possible.

Step 1 - Import our HD RP 10.2+ Unity 2020.2 Advanced Foliage Pack compatibility pack.
Step 2 - Setup Shadows and other render setups.

Go to Project settings -> HDRP default Settings ->default diffusion profile assets --> drag and drop our SSS settings diffusion profiles for foliage into Diffusion profile list:
NM_SSSSettings_Skin_Foliage
Without this foliage materials will not become affected by scattering.
